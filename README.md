# DiplomaProject
This is a graduation project of three students of Astana IT University: Valerii Pankov, Alikhan Zhuma and Rodion Kuznetsov.
Our project is a Telegram bot that checks links and files for malware, identifies suspicious numbers, and can answer questions about cybersecurity theory.
In MalCheckerBotV25.py the entire basic code for the bot is located.
The following key files are required for a full launch: config_ob.py , malcheckerbot.json and .env.
And also in the file requirements.txt all Python libraries that need to be pre-installed are listed.
This graduation project uses a variety of external services.
To check links and files: VirusTotal, ScamAdviser and Google Safe Browsing.
There are also ScamCalls for checking numbers, and the AI/ML API service for communicating with AI.
